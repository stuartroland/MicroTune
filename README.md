# MicroTune

MicroTune is a library for working with microtonal musical notes, intervals, temperaments, and scales. 

Intervals can be defined as ratios (as for Just-Intonation), cents values, or scalar values, all of which can be used together and operated upon with standard operators. The can be added to or subtracted from one another to yield new intervals and can be scaled by multiplying with floats and ints. 

Notes (frequencies) are defined as Hz values and can be operated on with intervals to yield other notes.

Collections of intervals can be defined as temperaments, such as equal temperaments, chromatic scales, and just intonations.

Scales can be defined as subsets of temperaments to keep all of the musically important information together in one object.
